## Version testing

OpenCore version : 0.9.4

macOS version : Ventura 13.5 (22G74)

## Other notes

USB may need to customize it yourself, as in [link][USB].

If you have headphone (sound card) problem, you can modify the alcid in boot-args, and try one by one according to the layout value in [codec table][codec], until you find the right one.

Here are the current layout values for ALC256.
5, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 33, 56, 57, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 76, 77, 88, 97, 99

** need to replace the serial number, UUID and other data, default is empty. **

The functions and enablement of each component are roughly shown in the figure (there may be inaccurate and modified parts, subject to the actual)
